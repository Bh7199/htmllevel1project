        <h4 style="color:blue">Introduction</h4>
        <p style="margin:auto ; color: blueviolet;background-color: beige;"> Some businesses have a long story behind their existence. And on the other hand, some do not.<br>
             Some have achieved many milestones, and some are just first-timers.

            Whatever be the background <br>
            story, sharing it here with the website visitors creates an emotional connection. <br>
            This is the place you should share where you came from and your backstory, especially <br>
            if you or the founders of the company have an interesting story behind what sparked <br>
            the idea for your product or service. </p><br>
            
           <p style="color:blueviolet;background-color:beige;"> Donâ€™t  away to mention even the failures and wasted efforts that have been <br>
            invested to finally achieve success. 
            
            Skimming the vital information to share is the key.<br>
             Suppose your business has been around for 5 decades, you need not give a year-by-year<br>
              account of the happenings!
            
            Share your business strategy and the way you intend<br>
             to be perceived. Throw light on the way your business has evolved, the ideas that <br>
             have contributed to the process. Talk about how you as a business are always<br>
              willing to change, adapt, and evolve as per the changing needs of the industry.</p>
